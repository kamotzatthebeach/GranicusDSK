	This is a software based down stream keyer to be used with a video switcher that has alpha keying  capabilities.  The point of the project was to create a low cost or no cost solution to provide on screen effects for our live video productions using existing hardware.  The project was created using Microsoft Visual C# 2010 and written in C# using WPF instead of windows forms.  
	When started, the program creates a control window to control the on-screen effects and it uses a monitor other than the main monitor as the display by loading a fullscreen form.  This would be the feed that is input into the switcher and displayed over live video.  The second monitor should have a set resolution of 1280x1024.
	The next step in development is to add more animation features and to integrate the program with Granicus.  Granicus integration will involve being able to download agenda information from Granicus to the software to display onscreen as needed and to provide a link from the live manager software to my DSK.  This would allow the onscreen display to change automatically as the clerk indexes the meeting.
	This is my first program using C# and WPF.  I come from a background in Unix programming with C so this has been a learning experience for me and look forward to developing the software.  As to the specific nature of the software I’m not expecting many to find much interest in it but I would welcome any comments and criticism as my programming etiquette is quite outdated and lacking.
